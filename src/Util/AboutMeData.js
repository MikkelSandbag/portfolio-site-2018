		'Most of my <a href="/my-work">professional work</a> has been as a front end web developer, but I love learning new things and have a healthy amount of curiosity about other technologies and platforms. The main guiding principle for my work is to make sure that what I do is making a positive impact on the world. Whether that is making improvements to <a href="/my-work/experts-exchange-live-product-redesign">a site that helps people find answers to their tech questions</a>, building a <a to="/my-work/apc-entertainment-website-design-and-development">website for a DJ and entertainer to grow their business</a>, or <a href="/my-work/friend-quest-podcast-production">making a podcast to entertain and tell a good story</a>, my goal in life is to do what I can to help others and make the world a little better &mdash; or even a lot better.'
